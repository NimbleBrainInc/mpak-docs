mpak is a package registry for distributing capabilities that make AI agents smarter. Think **npm for AI agents**.

```bash
# Search for MCP bundles
mpak bundle search postgres

# Run an MCP server instantly
mpak bundle run @nimblebraininc/echo
```

No manual dependency installation. No configuration. Just works.

## The Problem

AI agents are generalists. They become powerful when you give them specialized tools and knowledge. But distributing these capabilities is a mess:

- **MCP servers** require manual dependency management and complex setup
- **Skills** are copy-pasted between projects with no versioning
- **Discovery** means searching GitHub and hoping you find something that works

## Two Types of Capabilities

mpak distributes two types of agent capabilities:

  <Card title="MCP Bundles" icon="plug" href="/bundles/what-is-mcpb">
    Tools and integrations that give agents the ability to **do** things, like query databases, call APIs, or interact with external systems.

    Knowledge and behaviors that make agents **smarter** at specific domains, like code review, legal analysis, or sales methodology.

## The mpak Ecosystem

| Component | URL | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Registry UI | [mpak.dev](https://mpak.dev) | Browse and search capabilities |
| Registry API | `api.mpak.dev` | Programmatic access |
| CLI | [@nimblebrain/mpak](https://npmjs.com/package/@nimblebrain/mpak) | Search, pull, run |

## How Publishing Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a manifest">
    Add `manifest.json` (for bundles) or `SKILL.md` (for skills) to your repo
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the GitHub Action">
    Use [mcpb-pack](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/mcpb-pack) or [skill-pack](https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/skill-pack)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a release">
    Tag and release on GitHub. The action builds, uploads, and announces to mpak.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Users discover and run">
    `mpak bundle search` to find it, `mpak bundle run` to use it
  </Step>
</Steps>

Publishing uses [GitHub OIDC](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) for authentication. No API keys to manage, and the registry cryptographically verifies which repo published each bundle.
