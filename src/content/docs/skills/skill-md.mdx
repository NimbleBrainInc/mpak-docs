import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter describing the skill and markdown content containing the instructions.

## Minimal Example

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review with security and performance focus
---

# Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, analyze for:

1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Check for injection, XSS, auth issues
2. **Performance** - Look for N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations
3. **Maintainability** - Ensure code is readable and well-structured
```

## Full Schema

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review with security and performance focus

# Optional fields
license: MIT
compatibility: Claude Code only
allowed-tools: Read Grep Bash

# Discovery metadata (recommended)
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  category: development
  tags:
    - code-review
    - security
    - best-practices
  triggers:
    - "review this code"
    - "check for bugs"
    - "code review"
  surfaces:
    - claude-code
  author:
    name: Your Name

## Fields from Agent Skills Spec

These fields are defined by the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

### Required

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Skill identifier. Max 64 chars, lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens. Must match directory name. |
| `description` | What the skill does and when to use it. Max 1024 chars. |

### Optional

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `license` | SPDX license identifier (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`) |
| `compatibility` | Environment requirements (intended product, system packages, network access) |
| `allowed-tools` | Space-separated list of tools the skill can use (experimental) |
| `metadata` | Key-value mapping for additional properties |

## mpak Registry Fields

These fields are used by mpak for discovery and publishing. They go inside the `metadata` section:

| Field | Description | Required for mpak? |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `metadata.version` | Semantic version (e.g., `1.0.0`) | **Yes** |
| `metadata.category` | Category for filtering: `development`, `writing`, `research`, etc. | Recommended |
| `metadata.tags` | Array of tags for discovery | Recommended |
| `metadata.triggers` | Phrases that activate this skill | Recommended |
| `metadata.surfaces` | Where the skill runs: `claude-code`, `chat`, etc. | Optional |
| `metadata.author.name` | Author name | Optional |
| `metadata.author.url` | Author URL (GitHub, website) | Optional |

<Aside>
The `metadata` field is part of the Agent Skills spec as a generic key-value store. mpak uses specific keys within it for registry features.

## The Markdown Content

After the frontmatter, write the skill instructions in markdown:

```markdown

name: code-reviewer

# Code Review Guidelines

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks you to review code, check for bugs,
or analyze code quality.

## Review Process

1. **Read the code** - Understand what it does
2. **Check for security issues** - SQL injection, XSS, etc.
3. **Check for performance** - N+1 queries, memory leaks
4. **Check for maintainability** - Naming, structure, complexity

## Common Issues to Flag

### Security
- Unsanitized user input
- Hardcoded credentials
- Missing authentication checks

### Performance
- Unnecessary database queries
- Large memory allocations
- Blocking operations in async code
```

## Best Practices

### Write Clear Instructions

Be specific about what the skill should do:

```markdown
✓ Good:
"When reviewing code, always check for SQL injection by looking for
string concatenation in database queries."

✗ Vague:
"Check for security issues."
```

### Include Examples

Show the agent what good output looks like:

```markdown
## Example Review

For this code:
\`\`\`python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
\`\`\`

Flag as: **Security Issue - SQL Injection**
Suggest: Use parameterized queries instead.
```

### Define Scope

Tell the agent when to use (and not use) the skill:

```markdown
## When to Use

- User asks to "review this code"
- User asks to "check for bugs"
- User asks about code quality

## When NOT to Use

- Writing new code (use a different skill)
- Explaining existing code (just explain normally)
```

### Use Allowed Tools

If your skill needs specific tools, declare them:

```yaml
allowed-tools: Read Grep Bash
```

This tells the agent which tools are available when using this skill.

## Validation

The skill-pack action validates your SKILL.md:

- Required fields present
- Name matches directory
- Valid YAML syntax
- Version format (if specified)

Run with `fail-on-warning: true` to catch issues early.
