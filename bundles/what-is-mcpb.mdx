title: "What is an MCP Bundle?"
description: "Understanding MCPB and why it matters for distributing MCP servers"
---

If you've tried to share an MCP server with someone, you know the pain: clone the repo, install the right Python or Node version, run dependency installation, configure paths, hope nothing breaks. MCPB solves this.

## The Problem with MCP Servers Today

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is powerful. It lets AI assistants like Claude interact with external tools and data. But distributing MCP servers is a mess:

```bash
# The typical "installation" experience
git clone https://github.com/someone/cool-mcp-server
cd cool-mcp-server
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Now figure out how to configure Claude Desktop...
# Hope the Python version is compatible...
# Debug why it's not working...
```

This friction kills adoption. Great tools sit unused because installation is too hard.

## What MCPB Does

**MCPB (MCP Bundle)** is a packaging format that bundles an MCP server with everything it needs to run:

```
my-server.mcpb (a zip file)
├── manifest.json     # Metadata + how to run it
├── src/              # Your server code
└── deps/             # ALL dependencies, vendored
```

One file. Everything included. No installation steps.

## One Command

With MCPB + mpak:

```bash
# That's it. That's the whole installation.
mpak bundle run @nimblebraininc/postgres-mcp
```

The CLI:
1. Downloads the `.mcpb` file from the registry
2. Extracts it locally
3. Runs the server with the bundled dependencies

No Python version conflicts. No missing dependencies. No path configuration. It just works.

## How It Works

### 1. Dependencies Are Vendored

When you build a bundle, all dependencies are copied into the bundle itself:

| Server Type | Dependencies Location |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Python | `deps/` directory (via `pip install --target`) |
| Node.js | `node_modules/` (via `npm install`) |
| Binary | The compiled executable itself |

The server runs using these bundled dependencies, not whatever's installed on the user's system.

### 2. The Manifest Describes Everything

The `manifest.json` tells mpak how to run the server:

```json
{
  "name": "@yourorg/postgres-mcp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Query PostgreSQL databases",
  "server": {
    "type": "python",
    "mcp_config": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "postgres_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "${__dirname}/deps"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `${__dirname}` variable resolves to wherever the bundle is extracted, so paths always work.

### 3. Platform-Specific When Needed

Pure Python and Node.js bundles work everywhere. But if your server has native dependencies (C extensions, Rust bindings), you can build platform-specific bundles:

```
@yourorg/postgres-mcp@1.0.0
├── darwin-arm64.mcpb   # macOS Apple Silicon
├── darwin-x64.mcpb     # macOS Intel
├── linux-x64.mcpb      # Linux x64
└── linux-arm64.mcpb    # Linux ARM
```

mpak automatically downloads the right one for the user's system.

## Why This Matters

### For Users

- **Zero friction** - `mpak bundle run @org/server` and you're done
- **Reproducible** - Same bundle, same behavior, every time
- **No conflicts** - Bundled dependencies don't interfere with your system

### For Authors

- **Ship once, run everywhere** - Build it, publish it, forget about "works on my machine"
- **No support burden** - Users don't file issues about installation problems
- **Version control** - Users can pin to specific versions

### For the Ecosystem

- **Discoverability** - Search [mpak.dev](https://mpak.dev) to find servers
- **Trust** - Provenance tracking shows exactly where bundles came from
- **Standards** - One format means tools can build on top of it

## MCPB vs. Other Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Git clone + install** | Familiar | Dependency hell, version conflicts |
| **Docker** | Isolated | Heavy, requires Docker, overkill for CLI tools |
| **System packages** | Native | Platform-specific, complex publishing |
| **MCPB** | Lightweight, portable, bundled deps | Requires mpak CLI |

MCPB hits the sweet spot: lightweight like a script, reliable like a container.

## The Specification

MCPB is an open specification maintained at [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb).

Key points:
- `.mcpb` files are zip archives
- `manifest.json` is required at the root
- Dependencies are vendored (not referenced)
- Platform metadata enables multi-platform distribution

mpak is one implementation of the MCPB spec. Others can build compatible tools.

## Try It

See MCPB in action:

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install -g @nimblebrain/mpak

# Search for a server
mpak bundle search echo

# Run it instantly
mpak bundle run @nimblebraininc/echo
```

No setup. No configuration. Just works.
