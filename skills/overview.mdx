Skills are markdown files that give AI agents domain-specific knowledge and behaviors. Unlike MCP bundles which provide tools, skills provide expertise.

## What Is a Skill?

A skill is a `SKILL.md` file that teaches an agent how to approach a specific domain:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review with security and performance focus
metadata:
  category: development
  triggers:
    - "review this code"
    - "check for bugs"
---

# Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, focus on:

1. **Security vulnerabilities**
   - SQL injection
   - XSS attacks
   ...
```

Skills are used by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) and other AI development tools.

## Quick Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create SKILL.md">
    Write your skill with YAML frontmatter
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add GitHub Action">
    Use the skill-pack action to build and publish
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Release">
    Tag and release on GitHub
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    Your skill is live on mpak.dev
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Repository

```
my-skills/
├── code-reviewer/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── test-writer/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── doc-generator/
    └── SKILL.md
```

Each directory with a `SKILL.md` file becomes a separate skill package.

## The Workflow

Add to `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Publish Skills
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

permissions:
  contents: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: NimbleBrainInc/skill-pack@v1
```

When you publish a release, this will:
1. Find all `SKILL.md` files in your repository
2. Validate the frontmatter
3. Package each skill into a `.skill` bundle
4. Upload to your GitHub release
5. Announce to mpak.dev

## Package Naming

Skills are automatically scoped to your GitHub owner:

| GitHub Owner | Skill Name |
|--------------|------------|
| `NimbleBrainInc` | `@nimblebraininc/code-reviewer` |
| `johndoe` | `@johndoe/code-reviewer` |

The directory name (e.g., `code-reviewer`) becomes the package name.

## README Badges

Once published, add a badge to your README:

```markdown
[![mpak](https://api.mpak.dev/v1/skills/@yourorg/your-skill/badge.svg)](https://mpak.dev/skills/@yourorg/your-skill)
```

**Available badge types:**

| Type | URL | Shows |
|------|-----|-------|
| Version (default) | `.../badge.svg` | Latest version |
| Downloads | `.../badge.svg?type=downloads` | Total downloads |

You can also copy badge markdown directly from your skill page on [mpak.dev](https://mpak.dev).
