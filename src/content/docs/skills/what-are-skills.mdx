MCP bundles give agents the ability to **do** things. Skills give agents the knowledge to **think** about things. They're two sides of the same coin.

## The Difference: Tools vs. Knowledge

Consider what makes a great code reviewer:

| They Need | How They Get It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Ability to read files | MCP server with `read_file` tool |
| Ability to search code | MCP server with `grep` tool |
| **Knowledge of what to look for** | **A skill** |
| **Understanding of security patterns** | **A skill** |
| **Judgment about code quality** | **A skill** |

Tools let an agent take actions. Skills teach an agent how to think.

## What a Skill Looks Like

A skill is a markdown file with instructions:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review with security and performance focus
metadata:
  triggers:
    - "review this code"
    - "check for bugs"
---

# Code Review Process

When reviewing code, follow this process:

## 1. Understand Context
- What does this code do?
- What problem is it solving?
- Who wrote it and why?

## 2. Check for Security Issues
Look for these common vulnerabilities:

### SQL Injection
Bad:
\`\`\`python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
\`\`\`

Good:
\`\`\`python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
\`\`\`

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
...

## 3. Check for Performance
- N+1 queries
- Unnecessary allocations
- Missing indexes
...
```

When you ask Claude to "review this code," it applies this skill and follows the structured approach.

## The Difference

Without skills, AI assistants are generalists. They know a little about everything but aren't experts at anything.

With skills:

```
You: "Review this authentication code"

Claude (with code-reviewer skill):
"I'll review this using a structured security-focused approach.

1. **Authentication Flow Analysis**
   - Login endpoint accepts username/password
   - No rate limiting detected (SECURITY ISSUE)

2. **Password Handling**
   - Using bcrypt for hashing (good)
   - But timing attack vulnerability in comparison (line 47)

3. **Session Management**
   - JWT tokens with 24h expiry
   - No refresh token rotation (potential issue)

4. **Specific Recommendations**
   ..."
```

The skill turned a generic "looks fine" response into expert-level analysis.

## Why Skills Matter

### 1. Encode Expertise

Your best engineer's code review checklist. Your security team's penetration testing methodology. Your legal team's contract review process. Skills capture this knowledge in a reusable form.

### 2. Ensure Consistency

Without a skill, each interaction starts from scratch. With a skill, the agent applies the same rigorous process every time.

### 3. Share Knowledge

A skill you write can help thousands of people. Your security review checklist doesn't just help your team, it helps everyone who installs your skill.

## How Skills Work in Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) loads skills from your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        ├── code-reviewer/
        │   └── SKILL.md
        └── api-designer/
            └── SKILL.md
```

When you start Claude Code, it sees these skills and can apply them when relevant.

### Triggers

Skills define trigger phrases that tell Claude when to use them:

```yaml
metadata:
  triggers:
    - "review this code"
    - "check for bugs"
    - "security review"
```

When you say something matching a trigger, Claude activates the skill.

### Allowed Tools

Skills can specify which tools they need:

```yaml
allowed-tools: Read Grep Bash
```

This tells Claude what capabilities the skill expects to have available.

## Skills vs. System Prompts

You might think: "Can't I just put this in a system prompt?"

| System Prompts | Skills |
|----------------|--------|
| One big blob of instructions | Modular, composable units |
| Always active | Activated when relevant |
| Hard to share | Packageable and distributable |
| No versioning | Versioned and updatable |
| Clutters context | Only loaded when needed |

Skills are system prompts that got organized.

## The Skill Ecosystem

mpak hosts skills just like it hosts MCP bundles:

```bash
# Search for skills
mpak skill search "code review"

# See skill details
mpak skill show @nimblebraininc/code-reviewer
```

Anyone can publish skills. The best practices of experts become accessible to everyone.

## Types of Skills

### Development Skills
- Code review
- Test writing
- Documentation generation
- API design
- Refactoring patterns

### Domain Skills
- Legal contract review
- Medical literature analysis
- Financial modeling
- Scientific paper critique

### Process Skills
- Project planning
- Technical writing
- Interview preparation
- Incident response

If there's a domain where expertise matters, there's a skill for it (or there should be).

## Building Your First Skill

A skill starts with what you already know:

1. **Pick a task you do well** - What do people ask you for help with?
2. **Write down your process** - What steps do you follow?
3. **Add examples** - What does good output look like?
4. **Package it** - Put it in a `SKILL.md` file

That's it. Your expertise, made reusable.

## Try It

Install a skill in your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/code-reviewer
```

Create `.claude/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Thorough code review focusing on bugs and security
---

# Code Review

When asked to review code:

1. Read the code completely first
2. Check for common bugs (off-by-one, null checks, error handling)
3. Look for security issues (injection, XSS, auth problems)
4. Suggest improvements with specific line references
```

Now ask Claude Code to "review this code" and watch it follow your process.
